<h2>APPROPIATE CONTENT</h2>
<p>TJ students and staff enjoy the privilege of posting web sites. With this privilege come responsibilities as outlined below. Web pages are intended for educational purposes only. All web pages residing on the TJHSST web server must reflect the character and mission of the school and must not violate any rules specified in the Fairfax County&rsquo;s Policies and Regulations or the Student Rights and Responsibilities (SR&amp;R) document. Information may not be posted on the Internet if it violates the privacy of others, jeopardizes the health and safety of students, is obscene or libelous, causes disruption of school activities, plagiarizes the work of others, or is not approved by the principal or program manager. Web sites used for malicious or unethical purposes will not be tolerated. Web authors must not establish links to other pages on the Internet that are in violation of SR&amp;R policies. Violations of the TJHSST Web Guidelines will result in removal of the offending site from the server. The owner of the site may face further disciplinary action.</p>
<h3>PERSONAL INFORMATION</h3>
<p>Web authors must not publish any of the following personal information:</p>
<ul>
    <li>home addresses</li>
    <li>home telephone numbers</li>
    <li>social security numbers</li>
    <li>FCPS student identification numbers</li>
</ul>
<p>Pictures of students on web pages shall not be used if the students’ parents have withheld consent by completing the
applicable opt out of directory information form. If student pictures are used, only the student’s first name may
accompany the picture(s).</p>
<h3>COPYRIGHT</h3>
<p>Web pages must not present any copyrighted graphic images, music, or text materials unless specifically granted
permission by the owner of the copyright.</p>
<p>Web pages that use non-copyrighted materials developed by others should be well documented giving credit to the
proper author.</p>
<h3>WEB GUIDELINES</h3>
<ul>
    <li>All pages should include the date the page was last modified.</li>
    <li>Web pages should have some clear purpose and contain meaningful information.</li>
    <li>Web pages should not have dead links or links to empty pages. Authors should check external links on their own pages periodically to make sure they are still valid.</li>
    <li>Web pages must be designed to be compatible with all major browsers, should avoid the use of nonstandard tags and should adhere to W3C standards.</li>
    <li>Web authors should keep pages to a manageable size, avoiding excessive use of large, in-line graphic images. Small icons used as links to larger graphics is preferred.</li>
    <li>Web authors are expected to use common sense when designing pages and exhibit polite, considerate, and ethical behavior.</li>
</ul>
